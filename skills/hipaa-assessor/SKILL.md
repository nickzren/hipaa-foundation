# HIPAA Assessor

Use this skill to produce conservative draft HIPAA assessments of software systems.

This skill is the workflow layer only. The canonical corpus stays under `core/`.

Start with:
- `START-HERE.md`
- `references/index.yaml`

## Source hierarchy

1. 45 CFR text (eCFR) -- binding regulatory text
2. HHS/OCR guidance and FAQ -- enforcement posture and interpretive context
3. Repo interpretation -- non-authoritative assessment guidance
4. Target-system evidence -- determines the actual finding

## Prerequisites

You need:
- a target system to assess
- a resolvable `hipaa-foundation` checkout
- enough context to determine entity type and PHI scope

If the foundation root or target system cannot be identified, stop and ask for the missing path or context.

## Locate the foundation repo

Preferred order:
1. `HIPAA_FOUNDATION_ROOT`
2. current working directory if it is the foundation repo
3. an adjacent `hipaa-foundation` clone next to the target repo or current working directory

If available, run `scripts/resolve-foundation-root.sh`.

## Workflow

### Step 0 -- Check content policy

Read:
- `FOUNDATION_ROOT/core/provenance/content-policy.yaml`
- `FOUNDATION_ROOT/core/provenance/decision-log.yaml`

Do not use the repo in a way that violates the content policy.

### Step 1 -- Entity-role triage

Read:
- `FOUNDATION_ROOT/core/applicability/triage.yaml`
- `FOUNDATION_ROOT/core/applicability/triage-output-template.yaml`

Entity type must be determined from evidence in the reviewed corpus -- governance documents, BAAs, formal scope statements, or explicit entity classification records. Do not infer entity type from system function, clinical branding, device names, or health-data content. If the corpus does not confirm entity type, use `tbd` with `low` confidence.

When `entity_type` is `tbd` and ePHI is clearly in scope, the usual `applicable_rules` posture is `security_rule`, `breach_notification_rule`, and `enforcement_rule`. Do not add `privacy_rule` unless entity status is confirmed from the corpus. Always include `enforcement_rule` for context.

Before selecting domains, produce a structured triage block.

At minimum include:
- entity type (covered entity, business associate, BA subcontractor, not regulated, tbd)
- covered entity type (provider, health plan, clearinghouse, not applicable, tbd)
- hybrid entity status
- entity type confidence
- PHI types in scope
- PHI scope confidence
- evidence basis
- assessment confidence
- applicable rules
- Part 162 assessment mode
- state law overlay status
- in-scope domains
- excluded domains
- open decisions

After producing the triage block:
- Apply `domain_selection_rules` from `triage.yaml` to populate `in_scope_domains`.
- Read only the domain files listed in `in_scope_domains`. Skip excluded domains entirely.
- Retain `entity-and-applicability` in working context throughout the assessment. It governs downstream scope judgments.
- If `entity_type` is `tbd`, read `FOUNDATION_ROOT/docs/example-assessment-entity-tbd.md` for patterns on handling unconfirmed entity type, excluded Privacy domains, and evidence-basis limitations.
- If `entity_type` is `business_associate` or `ba_subcontractor`, read `FOUNDATION_ROOT/docs/example-assessment-ba.md` for BA-specific assessment patterns.
- If `entity_type` is `covered_entity`, read `FOUNDATION_ROOT/docs/example-assessment.md` for covered-entity assessment patterns.

### Step 2 -- Select domains

Read:
- `FOUNDATION_ROOT/core/index/domain-inventory.yaml`

Select domains from the canonical inventory based on entity type, applicable rules, and PHI scope.

### Step 3 -- Explore evidence

Read:
- `FOUNDATION_ROOT/core/checklists/evidence-map.yaml`

Use the evidence map while exploring:
- code
- infrastructure
- docs
- external governance evidence

Evidence basis branching:
- If `evidence_basis` is `repo-only`, read the `repo_only_notes` in each in-scope domain file's `assessment_guidance` before scanning. These notes identify which controls are typically organizational and should not be rated Gap on repo-only evidence alone.
- If `evidence_basis` includes external evidence, also consult the `external` evidence expectations in each domain's regulation files.

### Step 4 -- Assess each domain

Read:
- `FOUNDATION_ROOT/core/checklists/assessment-rubric.yaml`

For each in-scope domain:
1. Read the domain file (`review_questions`, `deep_assessment_probes`, `assessment_guidance`).
2. Read the domain's `regulation_files/standards` for orientation.
3. Read the domain's `regulation_files/implementation_specifications` for detail on each standard's required and addressable specs.

Read all listed regulation files for the current domain before moving to the next domain. Do not front-load regulation files for all domains at once -- work domain by domain.

For every in-scope domain:
- compare expected evidence to reviewed evidence
- separate missing evidence from observed gaps
- for Security Rule addressable specs, capture the disposition: implemented, alternative, documented_exception, or not_evidenced
- a documented exception backed by a risk analysis is Adequate, not a gap
- keep conclusions proportional to the evidence basis

Addressable-spec handling:
- `required` + implemented -> Adequate
- `required` + not implemented -> Gap
- `addressable` + `implemented` -> Adequate
- `addressable` + `alternative` (documented) -> Adequate
- `addressable` + `documented_exception` (documented risk basis) -> Adequate
- `addressable` + `not_evidenced` -> Partial or Gap depending on evidence basis

Repo-only realism rule:
Many HIPAA obligations are organizational. On repo-only evidence, the following should typically be Not assessed or Partial, not Gap:
- notices of privacy practices
- authorizations
- accounting of disclosures
- sanctions policy execution evidence
- executed BAAs
- training completion records
- breach investigation and notification workflow execution evidence

Domain severity anchors:
- For systems with strong technical controls but weak governance, default to Minor or Observation
- Escalate only with explicit rationale
- State the escalation rationale if overriding the domain default

### Step 5 -- Produce the assessment

Use:
- `FOUNDATION_ROOT/docs/assessment-output-template.md`

Every output must:
- **begin with the exact disclaimer** as the very first content: "This is a draft assessment for human compliance review. It is not a compliance determination and not a substitute for legal counsel."
- **end with the same exact disclaimer** as the very last content
- include the triage block before findings
- include a domain ratings summary table with `addressable_disposition` column for Security Rule specs
- include a detailed finding section for every row that is not `Adequate` or `Not applicable`
- show `basis_type` for each non-trivial finding

If `part11-foundation` is also being used:
- keep the same factual evidence across both assessments
- let `part11-foundation` own Part 11 record/signature scope and control ratings
- let `hipaa-foundation` own HIPAA Privacy/Security/Breach findings
- do not force identical labels when the repos are answering different questions

If `gamp5-foundation` is also being used:
- let `gamp5-foundation` own lifecycle, validation, and supplier methodology
- HIPAA risk analysis and GAMP risk assessment are related but distinct

### Step 6 -- Self-review

Run:
- `FOUNDATION_ROOT/core/checklists/assessment-self-review.md`

If any check fails, go back and correct the assessment.

## Output rules

- never present repo interpretation as binding regulatory text
- never hide uncertainty in prose
- never treat addressable specs as gaps without documenting disposition
- never collapse missing evidence and actual control gaps into one vague finding
- never produce findings for Part 162 in v1
- always keep the assessment usable as a draft review artifact for human compliance reviewers
